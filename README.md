<h2>What Is the Andarine S4 and GW501516 Value Pack?</h2>
<p>The pack includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Andarine S4</strong> (50 mg per capsule) – a SARM that binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone, boosting strength and lean mass.</li>
  <li><strong>GW501516 (Cardarine)</strong> (10 mg per capsule) – a PPAR‑delta activator that improves endurance, fat oxidation, and metabolic rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, they create a body recomposition effect: burning stored fat while preserving and building muscle.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>To give you honest feedback, I ran a structured eight-week cycle:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sourcing:</strong> I ordered directly from Chemyo to confirm shipping speed, packaging, and product quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 25 mg S4 per day split into two doses; 10 mg GW in the morning.</li>
  <li><strong>Training:</strong> Four weight sessions and three cardio sessions weekly.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet:</strong> High-protein, moderate carb, slight caloric deficit for fat loss.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Weekly photos, body measurements, and a simple strength log.</li>
</ul>
<p>I scored the pack on purity, price, shipping, potency, and overall results. Chemyo ranked top for reliable dosing, fast delivery, and clear instructions.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<h3>Week 1–2: Noticeable Energy Boost</h3>
<p>By day four, I felt sharper focus in workouts and better stamina on the treadmill. GW501516 really kicked in quickly. Cardio felt easier, and I pushed longer intervals without fatigue.</p>

<h3>Week 3–5: Lean Muscle and Definition</h3>
<p>Andarine S4 started showing effects around week three. Muscle fullness improved, and striations on my shoulders were more visible. I gained about 2 lbs of lean mass without gaining fat.</p>

<h3>Week 6–8: Strength Gains and Fat Loss</h3>
<p>By week eight, my squat max went up by 15 lbs and bench by 10 lbs. Body fat dropped roughly 1.5 %. My waist tightened and abs popped. I felt stronger and more defined than ever.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<p>Minor vision changes (night tint) with S4 and possible mild joint aches. They usually fade after cycle end.</p>

<h3>Q: Is Cardarine safe?</h3>
<p>Used at research doses (10 mg/day) for up to eight weeks, it’s well tolerated. Always follow dosage guidelines.</p>
